  abstract={In this paper, prospects of the utilization of the 4th stage of ISROâ€™s PSLV, after the completion of the launch mission, as an orbital platform, to host scientific payloads have been discussed. Payloads from 4 domains - Technological Demonstration, Earth Observation, Microgravity, Biology Experiments and the associated mission concepts have been surveyed, and comments have been made on their suitability to be launched onboard the orbital platform. Technological challenges in achieving these have been highlighted. Based on this analysis, two technology demonstration missions have been proposed by the team.}
